# About

Hello! My name is Hitomi Seki. I’ve been playing piano since I was 5 and one of my favourite things to do is playing popular songs by ear.

“Sheeteria” is my personal project to offer piano arrangement sheet music of the latest and hottest songs. The project’s aim is to help anyone play their favourite songs on piano, because it’s a pure joy!

I try to make my sheet music accessible to as many people as possible by producing two versions of arrangement for each song: one for intermediate/advanced players and one for beginners. So don’t worry what level you are, if you find what you like, follow the link to the sheet store and enjoy playing ;)

Have fun!
