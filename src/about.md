## About Sheeteria

Sheeteria produces piano arrangement sheet music and tutorial videos of popular songs. By offering high quality arrangements that can be played with simple techniques, Sheeteria aims to help every piano player of any level enjoy playing their favourite songs!

Please note that Synthesia (the piano visualiser) videos are auto-generated computer performance; they are for providing accurate demonstration of how the sheet music is played.

## About the arranger

Playing the piano since the age of 5, Hitomi Seki was classically trained as a child to obtain perfect pitch, basic music theory knowledge and music notation skills. She didn't go to a music college or pursue a musical career, but never stopped playing the piano. Since arranging music has always been a natural thing for her to do, she started Sheeteria in March 2021 hoping it would turn into something helpful for others while fulfilling her passion for music.

## About the arrangements

### Intermediate and advanced piano solo

The arrangements that say 'piano solo' are designed for intermediate and advanced players. They may contain multiple voices on one hand or rather tricky rhythms, but no awkward fingerings, fast repeated notes or chord voicings wider than a octave.

### Easy piano solo

Easy piano versions are meant for beginners. They are simplified enough but still sound good. Beginners should have fun playing tunes they really like, too, because that's the quickest way to improve!
