# About

Hello! My name is Hitomi Seki. I’ve been playing piano since I was 5 and one of my favourite things to do is playing popular songs by ear. It's a pure joy!

I started this project "Sheeteria" to share my piano arrangements online. All the arrangements have sheet music digitally available online, published legally thanks to [ArrangeMe](https://arrangeme.com/) program.

In order to make my arrangements accessible to as many people as possible, I produce two different versions for each song: one for intermediate/advanced players and one for beginners. So don’t worry what level you are, if you find what you like, just follow the link and enjoy playing ;)

Have fun!
