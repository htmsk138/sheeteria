# About

Hello! My name is Hitomi Seki. I’ve been playing piano since I was 5 and one of my favourite things to do is playing popular songs by ear. It's a pure joy!

I started this project "Sheeteria" to share my piano arrangements online. All the arrangements have sheet music digitally available online, published legally thanks to [ArrangeMe](https://arrangeme.com/) program.

In order to make my arrangements accessible to as many people as possible, I produce two different versions for each song: one for intermediate/advanced players and one for beginners. So don’t worry what level you are, if you find what you like, just follow the link and enjoy playing ;)

Have fun!

## About the arrangements

### Intermediate and advanced piano solo

These arrangements are essentially based on my improvisation. After transcribing the melody and the chords, I let my hands experiment with it on the piano and see how it goes. I assemble the ideas I thought sounded best into the sheet music.

This means I write nothing that my hands are uncomfortable with. I'd say I'm an intermediate-level player myself with hands of barely an octave reach, so the arrangements shouldn't be so difficult for most of the advanced players.

But sometimes I tend to prefer tricky rhythms. I usually give them some kind of patterns so that they don't confuse the player too much.

I try to make nice sounds with comfortable hand moves, because I believe awkward and complicated fingerings don't necessarily means "advanced". But it doesn't mean I simplify anything just to make it easy, so...good luck!

### Easy piano solo

Easy piano versions are meant for beginners. Beginners should have fun playing tunes they really like, too!

Unlike the advanced versions, I carefully choose the notes to be as simple as possible. I seek for the best sounds with the simplest rhythms and chord voicings for the song, meanwhile I don't tolerate bad sounds because the players wouldn't enjoy them.

But sometimes I'm not sure what makes it easier for the beginners, or if the melodies are simplified too much, etc. Feedbacks help it, so I appreciate comments on YouTube videos or social media postings to improve my easy versions :)
